# Why make this Project?

Originally I wanted to make a Quiz app to help me review my Arabic vocabulary. Then I thought, if I want this to benefit other people, making it into a game might help. With low attention spans now, a actually fun study game could help thousands learn the Arabic language.

Although this game is intended to work with other beneficial subjects, Arabic is the main one.

Any fiqh considerations must be taken into account early.
